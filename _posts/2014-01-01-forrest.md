I'm a recent graduate of Media Lab Helsinki, where my thesis focused on software *design for hackability*. This means designing modular software that can be easily taken apart and put back together to serve other purposes. I think that people that use software should be able to change how it works, and software designers should design for uses that they canâ€™t imagine.
